PerParentSequenceGenerator Stored Procedure 
Procedure Parameters:
Parameter	Data Type	Direction	Description
ParentID	Int/GUID	In	The ParentID for which to get the next sequence
Current
Sequence
Number	Int	Out	The next sequence number to use
Procedure Steps:
1.	Check if a record exists for the ParentID for the current StageDate (StageDate = Today()).
a.	If the ParentID is in the table for the current StageDate, lock the row and increment the sequence number.
b.	If the ParentID is not in the table for the current StageDate, insert a new record with the ParentID and CurrentSequenceNumber = 1.
2.	Commit the transaction, releasing the lock.
3.	Return the new sequence number for the current StageDate to the caller.

TableMaintenance Stored Procedure
Steps:
1.	Get yesterday’s snapshot from the Operations table by selecting all InsertDates less than today and placing it in a #TemporaryTable.
2.	Delete records in the #TemporaryTable that are also in StagedDeletions.
3.	Substitute records in the #TemporaryTable with records in StagedInserts if the IDs match.
4.	Update HasChildren and ChildCount columns.
5.	Populate any other precomputed or denormalized columns
6.	Populate the SortID with a row number partitioned by ParentID and sorted by Name.
7.	Create a clustered index on the #TemporaryTable on ParentID and SortID to match the clustered index in the Reporting table.
8.	Begin Transaction
a.	Replace the data in the  Reporting table with the data in the #TemporaryTable. 
b.	Unload partition for the previous StageDate from the StagedDeletions, StagedInserts and PerParentSequence tables. 
c.	Do not remove partitions for the current StageDate as those partitions are currently in use for reporting purposes.
d.	Mark previous StageDate as processed in your ControlTable. 
9.	End Transaction
